# Development Log 1
# Development Log (Date: 10/31/22 -- 11/04/22)

## Weekly Goals
The goal we set for ourselves this week was to figure out the way we wanted our code to function properly. 
We were deciding whether we will be web scraping or using a Wikipedia API for our project. 
We have decided to go with web scraping because that was the most efficient option for us to do.

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
All the tasks that our members did were done together. 
We had to discuss all our plans for this final project together so we had a good understanding of 
what is going on. After we all figure out what is going to be implemented in this project, 
we can officially start working on it. 

## Problems Encountered 
We haven’t encountered any problems at the moment, besides trying to figure out how 
we want to approach the code was the main situation. 

## Plans for next week
Our goal for next week is to start setting up and writing the functions that need to be 
implemented in the assignment. The main goal is that finish the Wikipedia setup using web scraping. 

## Optional: Questions for mentor

# Development Log 2
# Development Log (Date: 11/05/22 -- 11/11/22)

## Weekly Goals
Our goals for this week was two-pronged. First, we wanted to establish our methodology for pulling webpage information with C++, and also wanted to review, improve, and submit the project proposal. 

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
All group members convened during meeting times this week and worked together on research of algorithms and rewriting and adding to the project proposal. Meeting together in person allows us to remain on the same page on all details and improve each other’s productivity. Aashish was able to set up the Github page including folders and other necessary components. Ved set up the workspace for our team to work together using the JetBrains Client. Adi and Soumil helped finalize the the updated project proposal with focusing on the main algorithms in our project. 

## Problems Encountered 
We realized that a webscrape program written in Python as a means to take data from the website would not fit within the project guidelines. We have found an alternative in utilizing a C++ wrapper (Curl for People) for the Python program that does http requests. Also, we had to arrange for revisions of our project proposal. 

## Plans for next week
Finalize data collection and setup implementation of API for the http requests. This week will be stressful for all of us so workload will be to just fix data collection and make a UML flowchart for the whole program, and then a specific flowchart for functions the thread will go to based off our UML chart. 

## Optional: Questions for mentor
We would deeply appreciate it if we could setup a meeting early next week to discuss our project or to go over the project proposal before we resubmit for a regrade. Please let us know your availability.

# Development Log 3
# Development Log (Date: 11/12/22 - 11/18/22)

## Weekly Goals 
We decided to work on our UML flowchart for all the different classes and method we will need to write up for the project. We have a rough sketch for those details that we created through a shared Microsoft OneNote file. Also, we cleared up with the course staff that we can use python to pull our Wikipedia data off the web. Overall, the week before break is usually a hectic one, and therefore we had not allocated a lot of tasks to be completed this week. However, we do expect that over the break we complete the majority of the project. 

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
All group members convened during meeting times this week and worked together on research of algorithms and rewriting and adding to the project proposal. Meeting together in person allows us to remain on the same page on all details and improve each other’s productivity. The team worked together to create the UML diagram and talk through our implementations. Ved specifically contacted the course staff to confirm if we cna use python for data retrieval.

## Problems Encountered 
We are a bit not confident in how much work is ahead of us with all the classes to write up. We hope our design makes sense as we're not used to having to design the project from scratch, instead of just being given methods to write up like in MPs. 

## Plans for next week
Code Code Code. We'll assign classes for each person to write up, and also still need to actually get the webscrape set up. Those tasks will be divided up and completed by the each of us over the break. 

## Optional: Questions for mentor
Can we contact you during the break if we're stuck on something while coding?
