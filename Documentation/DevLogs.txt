# Development Log (Date: 10/31/22 -- 11/04/22)

## Weekly Goals
The goal we set for ourselves this week was to figure out the way we wanted our code to function properly. 
We were deciding whether we will be web scraping or using a Wikipedia API for our project. 
We have decided to go with web scraping because that was the most efficient option for us to do.

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
All the tasks that our members did were done together. 
We had to discuss all our plans for this final project together so we had a good understanding of 
what is going on. After we all figure out what is going to be implemented in this project, 
we can officially start working on it. 

## Problems Encountered 
We havenâ€™t encountered any problems at the moment, besides trying to figure out how 
we want to approach the code was the main situation. 

## Plans for next week
Our goal for next week is to start setting up and writing the functions that need to be 
implemented in the assignment. The main goal is that finish the Wikipedia setup using web scraping. 

## Optional: Questions for mentor
