# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
	Our team will be meeting every week at one of our apartments usually twice. Our meetings will last around an hour to two so we can all work together on the code in case we run into difficulties. If one of our team members is not able to join us, we plan on doing a discord call so we cann all still be working together and have the option to screenshare. We are not sure who will take the notes during each meeting, but we plan on alternating when necessary. 

2. **Assistance** 
We all have each others contact information such as phone numbers and are discord friends. If someone is waiting to get a response for a question, they should expect up not too much time until someone gets back to them, the max should be 1 hour. 	

3. **Respect** 
	Each member in our group is very respectful and we all listen to each other	s ideas whenever someone has something to share. If we want to ensure everyone to be listening and engage with each other thoughts, our plan is that when someone makes a comment, each member will have to respond with their thoughts before we keep moving forward. By doing this, it ensures that everyone is actively listening and communicating in our group to achieve success. 


## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
	Our current plan is that two people will be working on one function while the othert two will be working together on another. This makes sure we are being sufficient with our work and manageable with our time. Another thing we plan on doing is maybe for specific sections, working all together in our whole group can make sure we all are able to contribute properly. If a situation arrives with unexpected complications, one team will try to keep debug the issue, if unable to, they will send the code to the other team to figure out if they can solve it. If the two teams are unable to solve, both teams will all join together to find a new way to approach the problem. 


5. **Time Commitment** 
	Our goal is that everyone will be hopefully reaching 5-6 hours per week  for this final project. If something comes up where we will be busier a certain week, such as to compensate for midterms, we will change the recommended number of hours per week to adjust to oneâ€™s schedule. All of our group members have outside of class activities so we need to take into consideration their worldload for them. If something unexpected cocurs, our team will discuss a new game plan for the workload such as someone having to work a bit extra for a certain week. 


6. **Conflict Resolution** 
If there is a disagreement between the group members, we all have to communicate with eachother so we are still able to reach success. If someone or a subteam is not completing their tasks,. They need to let the other members know what is going on so we can figure a solution. We all are understanding if something comes up or is stuck on a certain part of the code. If someone is late, we will let them know that this is a recurring issue and they need to figure out a better way on coming more on time so we can all work together efficiently. If there is a disagreement on how a certain algorithm is supposed to be implemented, we will discuss the options that are possible and see which option will be best for us to implement. We will take into consideration the complexity, runtime, and other factors.
