The code is contained in the src folder. An example of how to use the Graph class is in the main.cpp file i.e. it contains a sigle specification of how the code can be run. The dataset is stored in the CSV folder under src. 

To run the code, follow a similar process as the mps by first making a build directory. Cd into that directory and call cmake .. 

Next, running the command make will make the project. To run main, call ./main. Similarly, to run the test cases, run ./test.
